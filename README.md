Advanced Python: Working With Data

Data science is one of the fastest-growing areas of technology today. And whether you work with large data sets or just need to process spread sheet files, Python is a great language to use when working with data-intensive applications. In this course, Joe Marini gets you started on working with data in Python, highlighting some of the most useful built-in features of the language. Using a real data set from the United States Geological Survey that tracks earthquake information, Joe shows you how to perform data operations like sorting and filtering, determining basic information like minimum and maximum values, and reading and writing data to and from other formats like CSV and JSON. Check out this course with Joe to see how Python can help you make sense of your data.
